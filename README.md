# couchdbpp
CouchDB C++ wrapper with curl and nlohmann json

This was made for testing purposes.

Thanks for Nlohmann Json for it's json library to parse json objects (https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

This requires curl to be able to compile, all tests were made with
Visual Studio 2022 and local CouchDB v3.3.3

This project only compiles in Debug mode x64.
